__HOW ARES WORKS__

ARES works with any test automation tool, any programming language, any test framework as long it has the ability to call a Restful API and with some information about the test you are running. e.g. test name, test result etc

Here is how it works:

In addition to your test automation code, you need to call 3 Restful APIs at designated places in your test automation framework. 

These APIs would carry some information about your test automation such as number of tests to be executed, test name, test status, platform used, error logs etc to the dashboard server in JSON format, which would then represent the data in some graphs and charts.
